# ENVIRONMENT-POLLUTION-
A deep learning project for environmental monitoring using semantic segmentation on satellite images to detect deforested areas in the Amazon rainforest. This project uses Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and a U-Net-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify deforestation from satellite data.
# DATA PREPROCESSING -
In this project, the data preprocessing phase involved preparing Sentinel-2 satellite images and corresponding deforestation masks for segmentation using a U-Net model. The images were taken from the 1_CLOUD_FREE_DATASET/2_SENTINEL2/IMAGE_16_GRID folder, and the masks were sourced from 3_TRAINING_MASKS/MASK_16_GRID. Each image and mask pair was matched by filename to ensure alignment, while unnecessary files such as .aux.xml were excluded. Using the tifffile library, both images and masks were loaded, resized to 256Ã—256 pixels, and normalized. Images were scaled to a [0, 1] range, and masks were binarized so that they contain only 0s and 1s, representing background and deforested areas respectively. After preprocessing, the dataset was split into training and validation sets with an 80-20 ratio. The final output consisted of 16 matched pairs, with the shapes of the training and validation sets as follows: X_train (12, 256, 256, 3), y_train (12, 256, 256, 1), X_val (4, 256, 256, 3), and y_val (4, 256, 256, 1).
