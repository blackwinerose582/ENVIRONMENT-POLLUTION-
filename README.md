A deep learning project for environmental monitoring using semantic segmentation on satellite images to detect deforested areas in the Amazon rainforest. This project uses Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and a U-Net-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify deforestation from satellite data.
